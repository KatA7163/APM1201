    "Write a Python program that simulates a music streaming service. Your system should support the following functionalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can \"subscribe\" to different music genres. Users can view their subscribed genres and discover new music. Users can play a list of songs from their subscribed genres. To implement this system, you will need to gather songs from various genres that are available for free or in the public domain on the Internet. Each genre should have a collection of songs that users can browse and play.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements: Implement a MusicStreamingService class with methods for subscribing to genres, viewing subscriptions, and playing songs. Create a Song class that includes attributes like title, artist, and duration. Ensure that users can browse available genres and the songs within each genre before making a subscription. Use an external source (like a public domain music database or website) to populate your list of available songs for users to explore. Bonus: Allow users to create custom playlists based on their subscribed genres and save them for later playback. Implement a feature to search for songs by title or artist."
